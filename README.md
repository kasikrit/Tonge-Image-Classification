## Abstract
Traditional Thai medicine (TTM) is a popular and increasingly accepted treatment option. In TTM, tongue diagnosis is a highly efficient method for assessing overall health, yet its accuracy can vary significantly depending on the practitioner's expertise. In this work, we hypothesize that deep learning-based transfer learning (TL) methods can achieve high accuracy in the Tri-Dhat classification of tongue images, a system that aligns with TTM principles and categorizes the tongue into three types: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. We propose an approach that uses raw pixel data and artificial intelligence (AI) to support TTM diagnoses. For our analysis, we used a unique dataset of genuine tongue images collected from our university's TTM hospital. To prepare the data, we performed class balancing and data augmentation. We then developed TL techniques with a variety of pretrained deep learning models. For performance comparisons, we utilized two-tailed paired t-tests and single-factor ANOVA. Our experiments showed that the DenseNet121 and Xception models produced the most significant results with cropped image datasets, including both DSLR- and mobile-taken images. Notably, an ensemble of these models yielded the highest average predictions. This ensemble achieved an accuracy of 0.96, a precision of 0.94, an F1 score of 0.96, a sensitivity of 0.96, and a specificity of 0.97. These results were further supported by a p-value of 0.0003 from the ANOVA analysis. We suggest that our methods could be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios to aid TTM practitioners in their diagnoses.
